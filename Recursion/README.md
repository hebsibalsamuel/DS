# subset method:
Adding one/ Ignoring one

# permutation method:
Different combinations of the strings with same count of elements
At each level the function call increases factorial times
At each branch depending on the processed length the function call increases by one.
EX: If processed = "a" unprocessed = "bc"
2 calls are made 'ab' and 'ba'
